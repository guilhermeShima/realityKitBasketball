# realityKitBasketball

This project uses RealityKit to simulate a basketball game. Through ARKit the app will detect a horizontal plane and plot the basket case and a ball.

The throw action is available by touching the ball. The goal was to use a long press in the screen, however RealityKit's notification is not working when aplying force to entity. (This functionality implemented in the project, while we wait for Apple to fix this issue :p)
